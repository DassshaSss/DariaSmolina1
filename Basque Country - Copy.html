				<h1> Basque Country </h1>
					
						<p>Kaixo, Zer moduz? Dasha da nire izena. I have just greeted you in the Basque which I have learnt while living in Bilbao, the biggest city of Basque country. I decided to share with you what I have learnt about Basque country during my Erasmus exchange which is both travelling and studying. Basque country is an autonomic area on the north of Spain and South of France which is home for a nation that includes around 3 million people in the world. Even though Basque country is officially a part of Spain, Basques do not consider themselves Spanish and share their own unique culture including language, sports, and cousin. 
</p>
<p>The Pyrenees Mountains separate the Basque region in Spain from the Basque Country of France. Diverse landscape, which combines mountains and Atlantic Ocean, has been attractive not only for tourists, but also for Hollywood production. There are several locations around Vizcaya region that have been used in Game of Thrones series. For example, San Juan de Gaztelugatxe is Dragonstone, Daenerys Targaryen's castle.
</p>
<p>
Next, Basques are very competitive people, and besides following modern sports (football especially), they keep their traditional sports as well. Basque rural sports are called herri kirolak. Herrri kirolak includes wood chopping, stone lifting, rope pulling, corn collection and even screaming competitions, that take roots in times when Basques still lived in mountains. 
</p>
<p>
My personal experience in Basque country was positive and full of events. I have managed to visit breathtaking nature locations, to learn basic Basque language, and I have even visited San Mames stadium and saw Messi in person. Despite being less touristic place then Barcelona, Malaga or Sevilla, Basque country is worth to be discovered.
