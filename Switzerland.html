				<h1> Switzerland </h1>
					<p>
						I have spent June 2022 working in Switzerland. Switzerland is a unique country which consists of 4 different parts with different languages and even customs. I have lived in a French part, which gave me chance to improve my knowledge in this language.
</p>
<p>
I have been working in camp for girls as a camp helper. I was supervising kids from around world for most of the day, including trips to different places. Mostly we were travelling around Geneva lace, which has incredibly beautiful natural blue color, and Alps.
</p>
<p>

Comparing to South of Ukraine (where I am originally from) and Lithuania (which is one of the flattest countries in the world), mountainous areas of Basque Country and Switzerland have made me fall in love with such landscape.
</p>
<p>

Switzerland very fun country to visit, however, it is one of the most expensive countries in the world, which makes it almost impossible to have fun without spending all the budget.
</p>
<p>I really have fallen in love with Switzerland, and would like to go back there, when I am older.
