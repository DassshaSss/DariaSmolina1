					<p>
						Welcome to Dasha's adventurous Blog!
</p>
<p>
My name is Dasha Smolina, and I am a Junior in LCC International University from Ukraine.
</p>
<p>
I have recently turned 20, and so far, I have managed to visit 10 countries and to live in 3 of them. Fun fact that my first trip abroad was at the age of 17, which means it took me only 3 years for travelling. All my trips I did as solo traveler, which gave me opportunity to explore cultures truly and to face all challenges independently.
</p>
<p>

In this blog I would like to share about my experience of living in 3 different countries. In: <a href="Lithuania.html">Lithuania</a>,<a href="Basque Country.html"> Basque Country</a>, and <a href="Switzerland.html">Switzerland</a>.
</p>
<p>

I hope my adventures will inspire you to go out of the comfort zone (which I personally know can be extremely hard) and to make own dreams of travelling make true!
